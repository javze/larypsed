human memory is infinite, so writing your ideas down is actually a very good thing. the principles of constructive art, on the other hand, offer us all an opportunity to make these ideas look rather simple, no matter of their complexity. thus, achieving a highest ratio between the scale of your ideas and their optimised visualisation is possible. based on natural laws, constructive art is universal in terms of place and time. it spares resources and has not only an aesthetic, but a strong social function â€“ to educate society in firm moral values and high spirituality until its complete maturation.
